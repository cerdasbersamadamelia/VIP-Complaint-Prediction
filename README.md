## ðŸ’¡ Project: **"VIP Complaint Prediction & Root Cause AI"**

### ðŸ“Œ Background
VIP & Enterprise customers are **high value** â€” large contracts, significant revenue contribution, and operator reputation at stake.  
Currently, complaint handling is **reactive** â†’ team only acts after a complaint is received.  
Problem: **delayed response**. Impact: contracts may incur penalties, customer trust decreases.

ðŸ”‘ Solution: **AI Early Warning System** â†’ predict potential complaints **before** customers raise them.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
1. **Complaint Prediction** â†’ detect sites/clusters at risk of VIP complaints within the next 24 hours.  
2. **Root Cause Identification** â†’ automate diagnosis based on KPI patterns (e.g., high PRB â†’ slow internet).  
3. **Prioritization Alert** â†’ send early warning notifications to the Network Engineer team.

### ðŸ”‘ Inputs (X â€“ Features)
* **Radio KPIs**: Availability, RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, PRB DL/UL, Max/Active users, UL interference, HO success rate, CSSR.  
* **Core & Transport KPIs**: Packet loss, latency, CPRI/VSWR alarms.  
* **Service-Specific KPIs**: WhatsApp success ratio, VoLTE drop rate, SMS success ratio, Gaming latency.  
* **Events/External**: Maintenance schedules, concerts, national events, weather conditions.

### ðŸŽ¯ Outputs (y â€“ Target)
**Level 1 â€“ Complaint Prediction (Binary)**  
Will the site/cluster likely generate a complaint in the next 24 hours? (Yes / No)

**Level 2 â€“ Complaint Category (Multiclass)**  
Predicted complaint types:
- Internet Lag  
- Coverage / Signal Issues  
- WhatsApp Call Issues  
- Voice Call Issues  
- SMS Issues  
- Gaming Lag

**Level 3 â€“ Root Cause Recommendation**  
Map prediction results to potential root causes:
- High PRB â†’ capacity overload  
- Low RSRP â†’ weak coverage  
- High UL interference â†’ poor quality  
- Transport packet loss â†’ core/transport problem

### ðŸš€ Value Proposition
- âœ… Shift from **Reactive â†’ Proactive** VIP complaint handling.  
- âœ… **Improve SLA & customer experience** â†’ prevent complaints before escalation.  
- âœ… Scalable to **all customer complaints**, not just VIP.
